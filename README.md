# Experiments with Grover's Algorithm

This repository has been created for a master's degree course 
about design experiments at the University of Costa Rica. It 
contains the code used to generate data to compare the Qiskit
and Cirq simulators.

## Grover's Algorithm
We use the 2x2 Sudoku solver as the benchmarking algorithm 
presented [here](https://blog.theodo.com/2022/10/quantum-sudoku/).

# Environment

To run this experiment, run the following commands in your python 
environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
